# Different methods of computing pi
## Goal
The goal is to compare ways to approximate pi to a set number of decimal digits (in a reasonable time).
The program will display a simple GUI which will contain the plot of the Monte Carlo method
and possibly some graphs with the runtime of different algorithms.
